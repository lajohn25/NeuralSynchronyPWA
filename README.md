# NeuralSynchronyPWA

Scripts uploaded to this repository were utilized to run Dissertation analyses for project titled: "Neural Synchrony During Naturalistic Language Perception in Listeners with Aphasia" by Lisa Johnson Norris (submission August 2021). Scripts included are: preprocessing of neuroimaging data (adapted from CR nii_preprocess) which utilizes clinical toolbox in SPM; and ISC analysis supporting scripts (developed by LJN and/or adapted from scripts found in nii_preprocess (https://github.com/neurolabusc/nii_preprocess); NiiStat (https://github.com/neurolabusc/NiiStat); or ISC-tutorial (https://github.com/snastase/isc-tutorial/blob/master/isc_loo.m). Roger Newman-Norlund helped in the development of rfMRI_ExtractTS.m, which was used to extract the timeseries of each voxel for ROI analysis.

This repository will be referred to in future publications, but more importantly is an organized location for future analyses when more participants are recruited. Word of caution for those who may want to utilize these scripts-- they do require pre-downloaded versions of other neuroimaging packages (SPM; FSL; etc). If you have issue using any of these please contact the repository owner.

Thank you.
